# GaussianFit
Code to fit data with two gaussian curves, find the area under each curve and plot the ratio of those areas.

Code created using MATLAB 2019b

Input data: The data should be uploaded as a matrix where the first column is the x-value for the curves and the following columns are the y-values
Currently there is a placeholder 'Data' to be replaced by the name of the matrix containing the data

The code will show each graph and pause for visual inspection of the fit. The fit can be improved by adjusting the coefficients of the two gaussian fit equation.
